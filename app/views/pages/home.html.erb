    </div>
    <div class="card-block">
      Snippety started when I was looking for a pet project while learning Ruby on Rails. The first thing I needed was a nice tool to collect my lessons learned and document my learning goals. I couldn't find what I need, so.....  Here is Snippety - alpha.

    <div class="card-block">Snippety is still a pet project, albeit one with ambition. The data you post is not encrypted yet and the images are hosted on a public S3 bucket. Be aware that Snippety is not yet suitable for sensitive information.</div>
